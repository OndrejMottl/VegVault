## Database linking global paleo-, and neo-vegetation data, functional traits, and climate

This is the official website dedicated to the VegVault project. VegVault is a comprehensive SQLite database that integrates global paleo- and neo-ecological vegetation data with functional traits and abiotic information including climate and soil data. By bridging historical and contemporary data across multiple temporal and spatial scales, VegVault provides a unique resource for examining long-term ecological patterns and processes, thereby enhancing our ability to predict future biodiversity trajectories and ecosystem responses under changing climatic conditions.

The project integrates data from multiple well-established sources including Neotoma Paleoecology Database, sPlotOpen, BIEN, TRY Plant Trait Database, CHELSA climate data, and WoSIS soil data to provide a comprehensive view of vegetation dynamics across space and time.

Creating such an integrated database, in which gathering and processing of the data is reproducible, is a crucial step toward improving our understanding of biodiversity dynamics under changing climatic conditions and safeguarding biodiversity in an uncertain future.

The project is part of [BIODYNAMICS](https://bit.ly/BIODYNAMICS) project.
