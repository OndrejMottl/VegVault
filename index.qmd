## Database linking global paleo-, and neo-vegetation data, functional traits, and climate

This is official website dedicated to the VegVault project. VegVault is compiling extensive paleo- and neo-ecological vegetation data into a single, accessible database, accompanied by functional traits, and abiotic information, such as climate and soil. By bridging historical and contemporary data, VegVault provides a unique resource for examining long-term ecological patterns and processes, thereby enhancing our ability to predict future biodiversity trajectories and ecosystem responses under changing climatic conditions.

Creating such an integrated database, in which gathering and processing of the data is reproducible, is a crucial step toward improving our understanding of biodiversity dynamics under changing climatic conditions and safeguarding biodiversity in an uncertain future.

The project is part of [BIODYNAMICS](https://bit.ly/BIODYNAMICS) project.
