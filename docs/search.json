    "text": "VegVault is a SQLite interdisciplinary database linking global paleo-, and neo-vegetation data with functional traits and abiotic drivers .\nVegVault integrates data from multiple well-established sources to provide a comprehensive view of vegetation dynamics. By organizing data into clearly defined types and providing comprehensive referencing, VegVault supports detailed and high-quality ecological research. This structured approach ensures that data are accessible, reliable, traceable, and facilitate a wide range of analyses and applications across disciplines.\nVegVault is organized into several sections to systematically manage the varying datasets it integrates. The main structure is the Dataset, which serves as the cornerstone of the database structure. Datasets are composed of Samples, representing individual data points within each dataset. Each Dataset will only contain several Samples if these differ in age. There are four types of Datasets:\n\ncontemporary vegetation plots\npast vegetation (fossil pollen records)\nfunctional traits\ngridpoint (a dataset type created to hold abiotic data, see details in Section III).\n\nFor the contemporary (1) and past (2) vegetation Datasets, the Samples hold information about Taxa as derived directly from the primary data sources. Trait information is organised in separate Datasets (as they are associated with unique information about their spatio-temporal location, references, etc) but linked to the same Taxa codes as those taxa in the vegetation Datasets (if present). Moreover, each Taxa, disregarding of the source, is associated with classification information (i.e.¬†species, genus and family name; see Section III)."

    "section": "Dataset",
    "text": "Dataset\nThe Dataset represents the main structure in the VegVault, serving as the keystone for organizing and managing data. Here we will explain some, but not all, of the features of the Dataset.\n\n\nDataset Type\nThe Dataset Type defines the most basic classification of each Dataset, ensuring that the vast amount of data is categorized systematically. Currently, VegVault contains the following types of Datasets:\n\nvegetation_plot: This type includes contemporary vegetation plot data, capturing contemporary vegetation characteristics and distributions.\nfossil_pollen_archive: This type encompasses past vegetation plot data derived from fossil pollen records, providing insights into historical vegetation patterns.\ntraits: This type contains functional trait data, detailing specific characteristics of plant species that influence their ecological roles.\ngridpoints: This type holds artificially created Datasets to manage abiotic data, here climate and soil information\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset Source-Type\nVegVault maintains the detailed information on the source used to retrieve the original data, thereby enhancing the findability and referencing of primary data sources. Each Dataset is derived from a specific Source-Type provides detailed information on the source, which was used to retrieve the original data, enhancing the findability and referencing of primary data sources. The current Source-Types in VegVault include\n\nBIEN - Botanical Information and Ecology Network\nsPlotOpen - The open-access version of sPlot\nTRY - TRY Plant Trait Database\nFOSSILPOL - The workflow that aims to process and standardise global palaeoecological pollen data. Note that we specifically state FOSSILPOL and not Neotoma, as FOSSILPOL not only provides the data but also alters it (e.g, new age-depth models).\ngridpoints - artificially created Datasets to hold abiotic data\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset Source\nEach individual Dataset from a specific Dataset Source-Type can have information on the source of the data (i.e.¬†sub-database). This should help to promote better findability of the primary source of data and referencing.\n\nCurrently, there are 691 sources of datasets.\n\n\n\nSampling Method\nSampling methods vary significantly across the different types of Datasets integrated into VegVault, reflecting the diverse nature of the data collected. For current vegetation plots, sampling involves standardized plot inventories and surveys that capture detailed vegetation characteristics across various regions. In contrast, fossil pollen data are collected from sediment cores, representing past vegetation and depositional environments. These sampling methods are crucial for understanding the context and limitations of each Dataset Type. Therefore, information on sampling methods is only present for both vegetation_plot and fossil_pollen_archive Datasets, providing metadata that ensures accurate and contextually relevant analyses\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nTo support robust and transparent scientific research, each Dataset in VegVault can have multiple references at different levels. The Dataset Source-Type, Dataset Source, and Sampling Method can all have their own references, providing detailed provenance and citation information. This multi-level referencing system enhances the traceability and validation of the data. VegVault currently includes 706 sources of Datasets, each documented to ensure reliability and ease of use. Each dataset can also have one or more direct references to specific data, further ensuring that users can accurately cite and verify the sources of their data.\n\nThis means that one dataset can have one/several references from each of those parts. Let‚Äôs take a look at an example, of what that could mean in practice.\nWe have selected dataset ID: 91256, which is a fossil pollen archive. Therefore, it has the reference of the Dataser Source-Type:\n\nFlantua, S. G. A., Mottl, O., Felde, V. A., Bhatta, K. P., Birks, H. H., Grytnes, J.-A., Seddon, A. W. R., & Birks, H. J. B. (2023).

    "section": "Samples",
    "text": "Samples\nSamples represent the main unit of data in the VegVault database, serving as the fundamental building blocks for all analyses. There are currently over 13 millions of Samples in the VegVault database (of which ~ 1.6 millions are gridpoints, artificially created to hold abiotic data, see below).\n\n\nDataset-Sample\nEach sample is linked to a specific Dataset via the Dataset-Sample table, which ensures that every sample is correctly associated with its corresponding Dataset Type, whether it is current vegetation_plots, fossil_pollen_archive, traits, or gridpoint.\n\n\n\n\nSample-size\nThe size of vegetation plots can vary, impacting the analyses and interpretations of the data. To account for this variability, information about the plot size is recorded separately for each Sample. This detail is crucial for ecological studies where plot size can influence species diversity and abundance metrics.\n\n\n\n\nSample age\nVegVault encompasses both current and paleo data, necessitating accurate age information for each sample. Modern samples are assigned an age of 0, while paleo samples uses calibrated years before present (cal yr BP). The ‚Äúpresent‚Äù is here specified as 1950 AD. In addition, each Sample from fossil_pollen_archive Dataset is also associated with an uncertainty matrix. This matrix provides a range of potential ages derived from age-depth modelling, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in dating paleoecological records. For instance, we include detailed age uncertainty information for a fossil pollen archive with an example Dataset.\n\nWe can show this on the previously selected fossil pollen archive with dataset ID: 91256.\n\n\n\nSample reference\nEach Sample in VegVault can have specific references in addition to the Dataset-level references. These individual Sample references provide detailed provenance and citation information, ensuring that users can trace the origin and validation of each data point. This level of referencing enhances the transparency and reliability of the data, especially when the database continues to be updated in the future."

Next, we have estimated the spatial and temporal distance between each gridpoint and other non-gridpoint Samples (vegetation_plot, fossil_pollen_archive, and traits). We store the link between gridpoint and non-gridpoint Samples as well as the spatial and temporal distance.

The resulting dataset allows users to study spatiotemporal patterns of Picea distribution over millennia. This can be accomplished by running the following code:\ndata_na_plots_picea &lt;-\n  # Access the VegVault\n  vaultkeepr::open_vault(path = \"&lt;path_to_VegVault&gt;\") %&gt;%\n  # Start by adding dataset information\n  vaultkeepr::get_datasets() %&gt;%\n  # Select both modern and paleo plot data\n  vaultkeepr::select_dataset_by_type(\n    sel_dataset_type = c(\n      \"vegetation_plot\",\n      \"fossil_pollen_archive\"\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  # Limit data to North America\n  vaultkeepr::select_dataset_by_geo(\n    lat_lim = c(22, 60),\n    long_lim = c(-135, -60)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  # Add samples\n  vaultkeepr::get_samples() %&gt;%\n  # Limit the samples by age\n  vaultkeepr::select_samples_by_age(\n    age_lim = c(0, 15e3)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  # Add taxa & classify all data to a genus level\n  vaultkeepr::get_taxa(classify_to = \"genus\") %&gt;%\n  # Extract only Picea data\n  vaultkeepr::select_taxa_by_name(sel_taxa = \"Picea\") %&gt;%\n  vaultkeepr::extract_data()\nNow, we plot the presence of Picea in each 2500-year bin."
