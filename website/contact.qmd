# Get in touch!

We would love to build a community around VegVault and there are various ways to get in touch and grow together.

## Contact us

We have set up [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/OndrejMottl/VegVault/discussions) as a main hub for communication. Do you have a question? Have you thought about a cool new feature? Let's write us a message. We hope that the **Discussions** page will serve as a line of communication to the developers as well as between various users.

## "It does not work!"

No software is without problems and if you find a nasty bug while using this workflow, please use the [Issues page](https://github.com/OndrejMottl/VegVault/issues) to report it.

Consider the following steps before and when opening a new Issue:

1. Have you or someone else asked about it at the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/OndrejMottl/VegVault/discussions)? The "Q&A" section is perfect for that!
2. Have you checked that similar issues may have been already reported? The issue tracker has a filter function to search for keywords in open Issues. You can narrow down the search using `labels`:label: as filters. See [Labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels) for more information. As a general rule, we don't assign issues to anyone.

To open a new Issue:

1. Click on the green **New issue** button in the upper right corner, and select **Bug report**.
2. Describe your problem in as much detail as possible. The issue should state what the problem is, what the expected behaviour should be, and, maybe, suggest a solution. Note that you can also attach files (e.g. sample data, R code, etc.) or images to the issue.
3. Select a suitable `label` from the drop-down menu called **Labels**.
4. Click on the green **Submit new issue** button and wait for a reply.
