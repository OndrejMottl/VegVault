## Example 1: Spatiotemporal patterns of the *Picea* genus across North America since the LGM

The first example demonstrates how to retrieve data for the genus
*Picea* across North America by selecting both modern and fossil pollen
plot datasets, filtering samples by geographic boundaries and temporal
range (0 to 15,000 yr BP), and harmonizing taxa to the genus level. The
resulting dataset allows users to study spatiotemporal patterns of
*Picea* distribution over millennia. This can be accomplished by running
the following code:

``` r
data_na_plots_picea <-
  # Access the VegVault
  vaultkeepr::open_vault(path = "<path_to_VegVault>") %>%
  # Start by adding dataset information
  vaultkeepr::get_datasets() %>%
  # Select both modern and paleo plot data
  vaultkeepr::select_dataset_by_type(
    sel_dataset_type = c(
      "vegetation_plot",
      "fossil_pollen_archive"
    )
  ) %>%
  # Limit data to North America
  vaultkeepr::select_dataset_by_geo(
    lat_lim = c(22, 60),
    long_lim = c(-135, -60)
  ) %>%
  # Add samples
  vaultkeepr::get_samples() %>%
  # Limit the samples by age
  vaultkeepr::select_samples_by_age(
    age_lim = c(0, 15e3)
  ) %>%
  # Add taxa & classify all data to a genus level
  vaultkeepr::get_taxa(classify_to = "genus") %>%
  # Extract only Picea data
  vaultkeepr::select_taxa_by_name(sel_taxa = "Picea") %>%
  vaultkeepr::extract_data()
```

Now, we plot the presence of *Picea* in each 2500-year bin.

## Example 2: Joined Species Distribution model for all vegetation within Czechia

In the second example, the project aims to do species distribution
modelling for plant taxa in the Czech Republic based on contemporary
vegetation plot data and mean annual temperature. The code includes
selecting datasets and extracting relevant abiotic data as followed:

``` r
data_cz_modern <-
  # Acess the VegVault file
  vaultkeepr::open_vault(path = "<path_to_VegVault>") %>%
  # Add the dataset information
  vaultkeepr::get_datasets() %>%
  # Select modern plot data and climate
  vaultkeepr::select_dataset_by_type(
    sel_dataset_type = c(
      "vegetation_plot",
      "gridpoints"
    )
  ) %>%
  # Limit data to Czech Republic
  vaultkeepr::select_dataset_by_geo(
    lat_lim = c(48.5, 51.1),
    long_lim = c(12, 18.9)
  ) %>%
  # Add samples
  vaultkeepr::get_samples() %>%
  # select only modern data
  vaultkeepr::select_samples_by_age(
    age_lim = c(0, 0)
  ) %>%
  # Add abiotic data
  vaultkeepr::get_abiotic_data() %>%
  # Select only Mean Anual Temperature (bio1)
  vaultkeepr::select_abiotic_var_by_name(sel_var_name = "bio1") %>%
  # add taxa
  vaultkeepr::get_taxa() %>%
  vaultkeepr::extract_data()
```

Now we can simply plot both the climatic data and the plot vegetation
data:

## Example 3: Patterns of plant height (CWM) for South and Central Latin America between 6-12 ka

The third example focuses on obtaining data to be able to reconstruct
plant height for South and Central America between 6-12 ka cal yr BP
(thousand years before present). This example project showcases the
integration of trait data with paleo-vegetation records to subsequently
study historical vegetation dynamics and functional composition of plant
communities:

``` r
data_la_traits <-
  # Acess the VegVault file
  vaultkeepr::open_vault(path = "<path_to_VegVault>") %>%
  # Add the dataset information
  vaultkeepr::get_datasets() %>%
  # Select modern plot data and climate
  vaultkeepr::select_dataset_by_type(
    sel_dataset_type = c(
      "fossil_pollen_archive",
      "traits"
    )
  ) %>%
  # Limit data to South and Central America
  vaultkeepr::select_dataset_by_geo(
    lat_lim = c(-53, 28),
    long_lim = c(-110, -38),
    sel_dataset_type = c(
      "fossil_pollen_archive",
      "traits"
    )
  ) %>%
  # Add samples
  vaultkeepr::get_samples() %>%
  # Limit to 6-12 ka yr BP
  vaultkeepr::select_samples_by_age(
    age_lim = c(6e3, 12e3)
  ) %>%
  # add taxa & clasify all data to a genus level
  vaultkeepr::get_taxa(classify_to = "genus") %>%
  # add trait information & clasify all data to a genus level
  vaultkeepr::get_traits(classify_to = "genus") %>%
  # Only select the plant height
  vaultkeepr::select_traits_by_domain_name(sel_domain = "Plant height") %>%
  vaultkeepr::extract_data()
```

Now letâ€™s plot the overview of the data
