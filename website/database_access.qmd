# Database Access & Usage

## Download VegVault Database

VegVault v1.0.0 is available as a comprehensive SQLite database providing integrated access to global vegetation, trait, and environmental data.

[Download VegVault v1.0.0 (SQLite)](https://doi.org/10.48700/datst.t21cz-2nq071){.btn} 

::: {.callout-note}
**System Requirements**: VegVault contains over 100GB of data. Ensure your system has sufficient storage space and memory (RAM) before downloading.
:::

### Alternative Access: Flat Files

For users who prefer working with individual data tables, we provide VegVault as separate CSV files:

[Download VegVault v1.0.0 (Flat Files)](https://doi.org/10.48700/datst.thktf-5rr35){.btn} 

::: {.callout-warning}
**Note**: Flat files are not the recommended approach. Many files exceed 1GB and may be difficult to load into memory. We strongly recommend using the SQLite database with the {vaultkeepr} R package for optimal performance.

## Accessing VegVault with {vaultkeepr}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="75%"}
To make VegVault easily accessible, we developed [{vaultkeepr}](https://bit.ly/vaultkeepr), a well-tested R package (>95% code coverage) that provides intuitive functions for interacting with the database. The package handles database connections, data filtering, and extraction, allowing you to retrieve only project-specific data without loading everything into memory.
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
```{r}
#| label: vaultkeepr-logo
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics(
  "https://ondrejmottl.github.io/vaultkeepr/reference/figures/vaultkeeper_logo.png"
)
```
:::
::::

### Installation

Install {vaultkeepr} from GitHub:

```{r}
#| label: install
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("OndrejMottl/vaultkeepr")
```

Load the package:

```{r}
#| label: example
#| echo: true
library(vaultkeepr)
```

### Quick Start

See our [Usage Examples](/website/database_examples.qmd) for detailed demonstrations of how to:

- Extract vegetation data for specific regions and time periods
- Access functional trait information
- Link abiotic environmental data
- Perform taxonomic harmonization

## Guidelines for Data Reuse and Citation

### Licensing

VegVault is released under **CC BY 4.0 License** ([Creative Commons Attribution 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)), allowing you to:

- Copy and redistribute the material
- Adapt and build upon the material

**Requirements**: You must provide appropriate attribution to VegVault and cite all primary data sources.

### Citation Requirements

When using VegVault in your research:

1. **Cite VegVault**: Always cite the latest VegVault version with its corresponding DOI
2. **Cite primary sources**: Acknowledge all original data providers included in your analysis
3. **Use our helper function**: The `vaultkeepr::get_references()` function automatically generates the complete list of recommended citations for your specific data compilation

### Publication & Pre-print

**Pre-print**: "*VegVault database: linking global paleo-, and neo-vegetation data with functional traits and abiotic drivers*"

## Important Limitations

### Data Quality Considerations

VegVault's quality depends on the completeness, accuracy, and reliability of primary data sources. We acknowledge potential issues in global ecological databases (as noted for [TRY](https://www.try-db.org/)) but focus on improving data re-usability rather than correcting source data quality issues.

### Technical Limitations

- **Storage requirements**: >100GB database size may be challenging for some systems
- **Memory requirements**: Large datasets may require substantial RAM for analysis
- **Version dependencies**: Always specify the VegVault version used in your research
