Found a bug or have an idea for enhancement? Visit our [Contact & Support](/website/contact.qmd#report-issues--bugs) page for detailed reporting guidelines.

### üìä Data Contributions

We continuously seek new datasets to include in future VegVault versions. If you know of valuable data sources that could enhance VegVault, we'd love to hear from you!

**How to contribute data:**
1. Review our [Database Structure](/website/database_structure.qmd) to understand current data types
2. Check our [Database Content](/website/database_content.qmd) to see what's already included
3. Contact us via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/OndrejMottl/VegVault/discussions) with details about your proposed dataset
4. Our team will evaluate the data for compatibility and integration feasibility

### üíª Code Contributions

We welcome contributions to improve VegVault's codebase, documentation, and functionality.

#### Prerequisites

**Git & GitHub Proficiency:**
- Familiarity with [Git version control](https://git-scm.com/)
- Understanding of [GitHub workflows](https://help.github.com/categories/bootcamp/)
- Experience with pull requests and collaborative development

**Coding Standards:**
We maintain consistency through our established [Code Conventions](https://ondrejmottl.github.io/collaboration/code_convention.html#coding-style). Please review and follow these guidelines for all contributions.

#### Contribution Workflow

**1. Fork and Setup**
- [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) to your GitHub account
- Check out the appropriate branch (usually the next version branch if available)
- Set up your development environment

**2. Development Guidelines**
- **Single purpose**: Each pull request should accomplish one clear, specific task
- **Descriptive naming**: Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `fix-database-connection`, `add-trait-validation`)
- **Small commits**: Each commit should represent one logical change with a clear message
- **Testing**: Ensure your code passes all existing tests before committing

**3. Submit Pull Request**
When ready to contribute your changes:

1. **Prepare your PR**: 
   - Write clear commit messages following our [guidelines](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-messages)
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Update documentation if necessary

2. **Create the PR**:
   - Open a pull request with a descriptive title and detailed description
   - [Link PR to any related issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
   - [Allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) for easier collaboration

3. **Review process**:
   - Respond to reviewer feedback promptly
   - Make requested changes and mark conversations as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations)
   - Be patient during the review process

**4. Merge Conflicts**
If you encounter merge conflicts, consult this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) for resolution strategies.
