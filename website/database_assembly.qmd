3. **Taxonomic Harmonization**: Using the {taxospace} R package to align taxa with GBIF backbone
4. **Trait Categorization**: Grouping traits into functional domains following [Díaz et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature16489)
5. **Spatial-Temporal Linking**: Creating gridpoints for abiotic data and linking to vegetation samples
6. **Database Integration**: Consolidation into unified SQLite database structure

### Reproducibility Through Version Control

All VegVault processing repositories use [GitHub Tags](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/viewing-your-repositorys-releases-and-tags) to ensure complete reproducibility. The specific tagged versions used for v1.0.0 are documented in both our code and documentation, enabling exact replication of the database assembly process.

## Data Processing Details

### Fossil Pollen Records

Fossil pollen records have been downloaded from the [Neotoma Paleoecology Database](https://www.neotomadb.org/) using their API on 26th June 2023. All data acquisition and processing have been done using the [FOSSILPOL: Workflow for processing and standardizing global paleoecological pollen data](https://bit.ly/FOSSILPOL) (version 1.0.0). This includes the selection of depositional environments, ecological groups, chronology control point types, and a minimum number of chronology control points to construct age-depth models. Individual samples and records have been filtered by age limits, number of pollen grains, maximum age interpolation, and number of valid levels. In addition, the accuracy of fossil pollen data is increased by re-estimating all age-depth models using the Bayesian probabilistic approach and including the information about individual age uncertainty.

**Selection Criteria:**

- Only records with type "pollen" with valid geological coordinates (longitude between -180 and 180, latitude between -90 and 90)
- Depositional environments: lakes, bogs, and mires only ([selection table](https://github.com/OndrejMottl/VegVault-FOSSILPOL/blob/v1.0.0-zenodo/Data/Input/Depositional_environment/Neotoma/depositional_environment_selection_2023-06-26.csv))
- Specific ecological groups retained ([selection table](https://github.com/OndrejMottl/VegVault-FOSSILPOL/blob/v1.0.0-zenodo/Data/Input/Eco_group/eco_group_2023-06-28.csv))
- Minimum 5 chronology control points ([valid types](https://github.com/OndrejMottl/VegVault-FOSSILPOL/blob/v1.0.0-zenodo/Data/Input/Chronology_setting/Chron_control_point_types/chron_control_point_types_2023-06-28.csv))

**Quality Filters:**

- Minimum 125 pollen grains per sample (balanced for data retention vs. quality)
  - While the preferred minimum was initially set at 150, this threshold resulted in significant data loss
  - Threshold adjusted to 125 with condition that less than 75% of samples would have low pollen sum
- Age limits: 0-20,000 cal yr BP
- Exclusion of samples older than 3000 years of the last chronology control point
- Minimum 5 samples per record
- Re-calculated age-depth models using Bayesian approach ({Bchron} package)

## Data Integration Procedures

### Final Database Integration Procedures

In addition to the consolidation of all processed data into a unified SQLite database, the final VegVault migration repository performs three critical procedures to ensure data consistency and usability:

#### (i) Taxonomic Classification

As VegVault integrates data on taxa from various sources, the {taxospace} R package is used to classify diverse taxa into a unifying taxonomic backbone. The {taxospace} tool automatically aligns taxon names with the GBIF taxonomical backbone. Specifically, we find the best match of raw taxon names using the Global Names Resolver, which is then aligned with GBIF. The resulting taxonomic classification information, detailed up to the family level, is stored for each taxon, ensuring consistency and facilitating comparative analyses across different datasets.

**Important limitations**: Taxonomic classification down to the species level is not available for each taxon (e.g., some fossil pollen types can only be identified to the genus or family level). For several taxa, no matching classification could be found. Note that taxonomic classification is additional information—the original taxon name is always present and returned by default. Finally, users should be aware that this classification is an automated process and may contain errors.

#### (ii) Grouping of Traits into Trait Domains

As there are differences in trait names across data sources (e.g., "Leaf nitrogen (N) content per leaf dry mass" vs. "leaf nitrogen content per leaf dry mass"), we added a new variable `Trait Domain` that groups traits together following the trait selection of Díaz et al. (2016). For example, trait "Plant height vegetative" from TRY and trait "whole plant height" from BIEN are both grouped under the "Plant height" Trait Domain. This grouping serves as an efficient mechanism for extracting comparable traits across both TRY and BIEN datasets.

#### (iii) Creation of Gridpoints for Abiotic Data

We developed a data structure that provides readily available environmental context for each vegetation (and trait) record by creating spatio-temporal links between these records and abiotic information. As raster data are not suitable for storage in an SQLite database, we created artificial points, called 'gridpoints', located in the center of each raster cell. This resulted in a uniform spatio-temporal matrix of gridpoints holding the abiotic information.

**Gridpoint naming conventions**: Dataset names (dataset_name) are created as "geo_[longitude]_[latitude]" and Sample names (sample_name) are created as "geo_[longitude]_[latitude]_[age]".

**Spatial-temporal linking**: We linked gridpoints with other non-gridpoint Samples (vegetation_plot, fossil_pollen_archive, and traits) and calculated the spatial and temporal distances between them. We retained any gridpoint Sample within 50 km and/or 5000 years from any other non-gridpoint Sample and discarded the rest.
