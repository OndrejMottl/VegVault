## References

The `References` table is a central component that serves all sections of the [VegVault]{.vegvault} database. This table contains all [References]{.database}, independent of the source of the [reference]{.database} and the type of data. Each row contains a single [Reference]{.database}, which is then linked to the type of data which is being referenced. This allows a single [Reference]{.database} to be used across data types, but also one data point having many different [references]{.database}.

Moreover, most [primary sources]{.database} of the data have a license, which requires [correct attribution]{.reproducibility}. Therefore, each [Reference]{.database} has information if such a [Reference]{.database} needs to be [cited]{.reproducibility} while using the specific data.
